# Important notes about legacy files

The files present in this folder should not be deleted. They are here to provide compatibility with different versions of our products which use them. Deleting these files *will* affect production users!

- The files `product-message_en.txt` and `product-message_es.txt` are needed for Add-in version 2.3.0.
- The folders `fancy-notification` and `product-message` are needed for Add-in version 2.4.0.

Once we are sure none of those files and folders are being used, we'll proceed to remove them.
