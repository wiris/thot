## Environments and branches

Given the nature of this project, no environments exist as such. Nevertheless, three different branches have been created to make testing easier:

* development: point to this branch if you need to try changes in your developnment environment.
* staging: point to this branch when you need QA or product to test changes previosly introduced using the development branch.
* main: use this branch to references files from production environments.

For each of this environments, the URLs you should point from your code are:

| Environment | Branch       | Base URL                                                    |
